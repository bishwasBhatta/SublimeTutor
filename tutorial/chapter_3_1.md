Multiple cursors
===================

Sublime Text provides you a way to put your cursor in multiple text blocks at the
same time. Use `Cmd` key with left mouse button and click at multiple places in
the document to put your cursor at all those places. Now, when you type
something, the text is appended at all the cursor positions.

* Multiple cursors - `Cmd key with left mouse button`


Exercise
---------

In the list given below, add an asterisk followed by space (`* `) in the
beginning of each item. Use `Cmd + click` method for it. Keep `Cmd` key
pressed and click at the beginning of each list item to place your cursor there.
When it is done, type `* `

```

tab
caps lock
shift
control
command
option
space

```


Multiple selection
===================

Extending the same discussion around `multiple cursor`, you can extend this
trick to select text at multiple places. Press `Cmd` key and then drag select
multiple blocks of text in the document. Once you are in multiple selection
mode, you can also use the usual `Shift + (up|down|left|right)`
shortcuts to select blocks of text


Exercise
---------

In the list given below, drag select the items with `<==` marked on them.
Now delete them and replace with three tildas `~~~`

```

tab
caps lock <==
shift
control <==
command
option
space <==

```


Transposing with multiple selection
====================================

In the last chapter, we saw how to transpose letters. Which is quite handy.
The superpowers of Sublime Text come out in open when you learn to transpose
words, or blocks of text. It is like magic!


Exercise
---------

In the JavaScript block given below, horse and pigeon have been accidentally
placed in the wrong blocks. You could use the transpose selections
shortcut that you just learnt, to fix this problem.

Just like what you did in the previous exercise, use `Cmd` key to drag select
the two words `horse` and `pigeon` first. Once both the words are selected,
you can see the cursor at the end of both words (affirming multiple selection mode),
Use the transpose shortcut (`Ctrl + T`) to fix the issue.


```js

let birds = ['parrot', 'owl', 'hummingbird', 'woodpecker', 'horse']
let animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'lion', 'elephant', 'pigeon']

```
